===============

Software PWM library for [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/), and other compatible AVR boards.

AVR microcontrollers provide hardware PWM on some pins 
but if you need PWM on other pins then it must be implemented in software. 
This library provides easy and efficient software PWM on any pin. Each channel can be set to a different PWM duty cycle.
